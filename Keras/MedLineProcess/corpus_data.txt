AB  - Protein kinases are highly tractable targets for drug discovery. However, the
      biological function and therapeutic potential of the majority of the 500+ human
      protein kinases remains unknown. We have developed physical and virtual
      collections of small molecule inhibitors, which we call chemogenomic sets, that
      are designed to inhibit the catalytic function of almost half the human protein
      kinases. In this manuscript we share our progress towards generation of a
      comprehensive kinase chemogenomic set (KCGS), release kinome profiling data of a 
      large inhibitor set (Published Kinase Inhibitor Set 2 (PKIS2)), and outline a
      process through which the community can openly collaborate to create a KCGS that 
      probes the full complement of human protein kinases.

TI  - Assessing Different E3 Ligases for Small Molecule-induced Protein Ubiquitination 
      and Degradation.
LID - 10.1021/acschembio.7b00485 [doi]
AB  - Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology, the recruitment of E3
      ubiquitin ligases to induce the degradation of a protein target, is rapidly
      impacting chemical biology, as well as modern drug development. Here, we explore 
      the breadth of this approach by evaluating different E3 ubiquitin ligases
      engineered in their substrate binding domains to accept a recruiting ligand. Five
      out of six E3 ligases were found to be amenable to recruitment for target
      degradation. Taking advantage of the tight spatio-temporal control of inducing
      ubiquitination on a pre-selected target in living cells, we focused on two of the
      engineered E3 ligases, betaTRCP and parkin, to characterize their ability to
      induce ubiquitination in comparison with the PROTAC-recruited endogenous E3
      ligases VHL and cereblon.

TI  - Bioorganometallic ferrocene-tripeptide nanoemulsions.
LID - 10.1039/c7nr03932h [doi]
AB  - We demonstrate an effective strategy to prepare highly stable nanoemulsions using
      ferrocene-modified tripeptides. Compared with traditional nanoemulsions,
      bioorganometallic peptide nanoemulsions are appealing for a number of reasons,
      including long-term and outstanding thermal stability, redox activity and
      biocompatibility. The formed nanoemulsions could remain stable for more than four
      months at room temperature, which is the highest stability reported so far for
      peptide and protein emulsifiers. The phase behaviour and size distribution of the
      emulsions could be precisely tailored by altering the temperature, solvent ratio 
      and redox state of the ferrocene moiety. In this process, we observed a unique
      enthalpy-driven phase transition from nanoemulsions to hydrogels, which could be 
      attributed to the competition between the interfacial free energy and the
      association energy among the self-assembling peptides. Moreover, we could impart 
      catalytic activity to the nanoemulsions through rationally altering the sequence 
      of the tripeptides. The structurally tunable, functional bioorganometallic
      nanoemulsions offer new opportunities in many areas including drug delivery, and 
      the food and cosmetic industries.
